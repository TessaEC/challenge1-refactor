## Description

The following issues have been changed:
*Cleaned and adjusted spacing in HTML code
*Changed < title > from < title > website < title > to < title > Horiseon - Search Engine Optimization Services and Information < title >
*Removed < div class = "header" > to < header > and removed class element
*In CSS removed '.' before header and footer to make a regular tag instead of class element
*Eliminated extra < divs and replaced section divs with < section >
*Replaced  < div section with links in head to < nav > and changed all div classes in CSS to nav
*Added id = "search-engine-optimization" to section so that when clicked it will also jump to that section in main to match Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing jump links
*Added alt text to all images for accessibility and SEO
*Changed footer from h3 to h2 for a better visual appearance on webpage
*Added < aside > tag to benefits section to view to the right of main
